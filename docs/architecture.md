The following is an attempt to capture the initial whiteboard design for `loom-app`.

Loom is a social programmable platform.

Each of those descriptors ties to three principals:
1) social : Own your organization (i.e. vote for you mods)
1) programmable : Own your view (i.e. how things are presented should be hackable)
1) platform : Own your data (i.e. your data is yours, so you should be able to use it in other programs)
