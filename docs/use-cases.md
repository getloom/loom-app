# Use Cases

In order to keep Loom's development somewhat focused the Dev team is currently using the following 4 "organization" concepts as driving use cases.

1. "My partner & I use Loom to help manage our household."
1. "Loom uses Loom to manage its community and infrastructure."
1. "A neighborhood social club uses Loom for community organizing."
1. "An up and coming publishing journal uses Loom for peer-to-peer production."
